# Electric Vehicle Charging Station Optimization

## Introduction

As electric vehicles become more popular, optimizing the placement of charging stations is essential. The current layout in Coral Gable,FL is suboptimal, concentrated in a few locations, leading to resource wastage.

## Objective

Our goal is to enhance the efficiency of charging stations in Coral Gables:

- Minimize the number of stations
- Minimize costs
- Maximize coverage

## Methodology

- Research area: Coral Gables
- Collected data for 40 crowded locations

## Model

1. Identify potential station locations
2. Add cost factors and select the best combination
3. Determine maximum coverage with a limited number of charging points

## Results

- Binary and Greedy algorithms provided different combinations
- Chose the best combination considering cost factors
- Determined maximum coverage with 4 charging points

## Conclusion

Our study addresses the challenges of low utilization and high cost of charging stations, proposing a cost-effective coverage model for optimized layouts.
