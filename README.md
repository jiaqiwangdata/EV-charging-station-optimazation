# Combining CML Line for Optimal Market Portfolio


## Introduction

Asset allocation significantly influences portfolio performance. We aim to enhance portfolio efficiency by introducing the Capital Market Line (CML) to eliminate unsystematic risk.

## Method

We analyzed stock data from four sectors and identified the auto sector with the highest Sharpe ratio. The resulting portfolio weights are:

- Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): 0.0000
- Bentley Systems, Incorporated (BSY): 0.2837
- Ford Motor Company (F): 0.2953
- Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC): 0.0648
- Toyota Motor Corporation (TM): 0.3561

## Conclusion

The CML helps investors minimize unsystematic risk. We selected the auto sector for investment based on its strong Sharpe ratio.
